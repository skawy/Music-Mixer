The purpose of this repository is to mix many songs as you want and save the output song

You are not just mixing songs but you can separate vocals or instrumental version of any song you have and for example mix first song vocals with second song instrument.

The main idea in mixing song is to wrap chosen song with **decorator pattern** and i think it is useful for extension in case you want to not just separate song in vocals and instruments only but with *Spleeter* you can separate the song up to 5 stems ( Vocals, drums, bass, piano and other separation )
